# CMSC-HW2

I created a website that tallies up the number of circles you click on before the clock runs out. You can enter your name which will send you to a page to show you the top 10 leaderboard. Do you think you can beat them?

To Run:
  <br>-install the latest version of Python, Flask, and SQLite3
  <br>-Set the flask app with: set FLASK_APP=app.py
  <br>-Run with: Flask run --port (port_number)
